When asked, to create a commit:
1. Run `git status` to check changes
2. Run `git commit` following Conventional Commits format in **English** (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`)
3. Help commit meaningful units of change rather than staging everything
4. Use `git diff [optional file(s)] | cat` when diff is needed.

When asked, to submit a PR (Note: Use `gh` and assume I am already authenticated correctly):
1. Run `git status` to check changes
2. Run `git add .`  to add all the changes to the staging area (IF NEEDED)
3. Run `git commit` to commit changes (IF NEEDED)
4. Run `git push`   to push the changes to the remote repository (IF NEEDED)
5. Run `git branch` to check the current branch
6. Run `git log main..[Insert current branch]`
7. Run `git diff --name-status main` to check to see what files have been changed
8. Run `gh pr create --title "Title goes here..." --body "Example body..."`
