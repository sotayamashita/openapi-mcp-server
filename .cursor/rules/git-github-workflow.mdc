When asking commit:
1. Run `git status` to show changes
2. Run `git commit` following Conventional Commits format in **English** (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`)
3. Help commit meaningful units of change rather than staging everything
4. Use `git diff [optional file] | cat` when diff is needed.
