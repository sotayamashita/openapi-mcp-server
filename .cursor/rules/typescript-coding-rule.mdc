- Use English for all comments

## Comments and documentation

### JSDoc tags

It allows a subset of JSDoc tags. Most tags must occupy their own line, with the tag at the beginning of the line.

```typescript
/**
 * The "param" tag must occupy its own line and may not be combined.
 * @param left A description of the left param.
 * @param right A description of the right param.
 */
function add(left: number, right: number) { ... }
```

### Document all top-level exports of modules

Use /** JSDoc */ comments to communicate information to the users of your code. Avoid merely restating the property or parameter name. You should also document all properties and methods (exported/public or not) whose purpose is not immediately obvious from their name, as judged by your reviewer.

Exception: Symbols that are only exported to be consumed by tooling, such as @NgModule classes, do not require comments.
